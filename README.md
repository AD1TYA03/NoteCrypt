# 🛡️ NoteCrypt

**NoteCrypt** is a simple, end-to-end encrypted note-taking web app built using **React** and **Firebase**. It ensures your notes stay private and secure by encrypting data before it ever touches the database.

🔗 **Live Demo**: [https://notecryptweb.vercel.app/](https://notecryptweb.vercel.app/)

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **End-to-End Encryption** of all notes  
- 📝 **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** functionality  
- 🔒 **Firebase Authentication** (Email/Password based login & registration)  
- ☁️ **Firestore Database** to store encrypted data  
- 🌐 **Firebase Hosting** for fast and reliable deployment

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS  
- **State Management**: useState, useEffect  
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Functions, Hosting)  
- **Encryption**: CryptoJS (AES Encryption)

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/notecrypt.git
   cd notecrypt
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Firebase Setup**
   - Create a Firebase project at [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/)
   - Enable Authentication and Firestore Database
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Firebase config:
     ```
     VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key
     VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
     VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
     VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
     VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
     VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
     ```

4. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🔐 How Encryption Works

- Notes are encrypted on the **client-side** using **AES encryption** before saving to Firestore.
- Decryption also happens on the client-side, ensuring that even Firebase can’t read your notes.
